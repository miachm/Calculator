# About

This code was a proof of concept. It was done some years ago (2013?). I hadn't even started my degree yet, so you won't see any popular algorithm for this problem. Instead, there are a lot of work arounds for try to solve the problem.  
  
But... It works great! Even when you don't know the theory, you can find a solution with cleverness. That's why i like this code.
